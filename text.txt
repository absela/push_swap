This code is a sorting algorithm called "push_swap" that is designed to sort a stack of integers. The main function "the_start" sorts the stack by moving the largest integers to a separate stack,
sorting the second stack, and then merging the two stacks back together in sorted order.

It starts by creating a new array, stack->index, which is a copy of the original stack->table. Then it calls the function "fake_table_sort" that sorts the copy of the original stack, in the stack->index.

Then it splits the sorted stack->index into two parts:

stack->var1 = stack->index[stack->totala / 8], this is the top 8th of the sorted stack.
stack->var2 = stack->index[(stack->totala / 9) / 2], this is the middle element of the top 9th of the sorted stack.
After that, it calls "ppb" function, which uses the variables stack->var1, and stack->var2 to determine which elements of the stack->table should be moved to the second stack.

Finally, it calls "b_to_a" function, which is used to move the integers back to the first stack in sorted order.

It repeats this process until the first stack has only one element left, meaning it is fully sorted.

The choice of 8 and 9 here is arbitrary and can be adjusted to optimize the sorting algorithm for different input sizes and characteristics.
